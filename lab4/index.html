					<h2>About the Lab</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab is to help get us used to using javascript as well as familiarizing us with the functions..</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first I didn't really understand the point of using javascript because I couldn't conceptualize it's function. In section however, Ilia went a little more in depth and I was able to understand the idea of the main javascript brain and it communicating with itself. </p>
